Dolores Deals Inc., a Delaware corporation, the provider of the Website (referred to as \"us\" or \"we\"), is committed to protecting your privacy online. Please read the following to learn what information we collect from you (the \"User\" or the \"End User\") and how we use that information. If you have any questions about our privacy policy, please email us.</p>\r\n \r\n<p><strong>PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND TO ALL THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR WEBSITE TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, EXIT THIS PAGE AND DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Changes to Privacy Policy</h3>\r\n \r\n<p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of notice on our home page.</p>\r\n \r\n<h3>2. Types of Information Collected and Uses of Collected Information</h3>\r\n \r\n<p>We collect two types of information about our Website Users: Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Personally Identifiable Information is information that identifies a specific End User. When you engage in certain activities on the Website, such as creating an account, ordering a product or service from us or our partners, submitting content and/or posting content in discussion forums, entering a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by us or our partners, filling out a survey, posting a review, sending us or our partners feedback, requesting information about our services, submitting an affiliate agreement, applying for a job, posting a video or signing up for special offers from third parties through the Website (collectively, \"Identification Activities\"), we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself. It is optional for you to engage in an Identification Activity. If you elect to engage in an Identification Activity, however, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, telephone number and date of birth. When you order products or services, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information. Depending on the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some is identified as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, you will not be permitted to engage in that activity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tell-A-Friend/Buy it for a Friend.</strong> If you choose to use our referral service or buy a deal for a friend, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email with the gift you bought for them or inviting him or her to visit the site. Dolores Deals stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, sending their gift, and tracking the success of our referral program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your friend may contact us at info@doloresdeals.org to request that we remove this information from our database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide products and services to you, administer sweepstakes and contests, enhance the operation of the Website, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, analyze Website use, improve our product and service offerings, and to tailor your experience with third parties as provided in Item 3 of this Privacy Policy. For example, if you send our customer service an email we may use your comments and feedback to tell others about our services, and may post your comment in our marketing materials or on our Website. Your comments may contain personal information such as your name, we will obtain consent from you to post your name along with your comment prior to posting your comment for public view. In addition, if you use our Website to send information or a product to another person, we may store your personal information. We may also use Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, resolve disputes, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, enforce our agreements with you, including our Website Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information.</strong> Non-Personally Identifiable Information is information that does not identify a specific End User. This type of information may include things like the Uniform Resource Locator (\"URL\") of the website you visited before coming to our Website, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Website, the type of browser you are using and your Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address. We, and/or our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers, may automatically collect this information when you visit our Website through the use of electronic tools like Cookies and Web beacons or Pixel tags, as described in Items 4 and 8 of this Privacy Policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to troubleshoot, administer the Website, analyze trends, gather demographic information, comply with applicable law, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may also share this information with our authorized Third Party Service Providers and Advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Release of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We will not share, sell, rent, or trade your Personally Identifiable Information with other parties except as provided below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We may share your information with Dolores Deals Merchants.</strong> From time to time, we provide offers from particular merchants (referred to as \"Dolores Deals Merchants\") who, as part of the offer, request information on Dolores Deals customers who purchased the offer in order to aid redemption. In those cases, we share some of your Personally Identifiable Information with Dolores Deals Merchants. Sharing this Information may allow a Dolores Deals Merchant to market directly to you should they choose to do so. We specifically disclaim any responsibility or liability for the actions of such Dolores Deals Merchant. While we inform them that they are only permitted to communicate with you for the purposes of the specific promotion with Dolores Deals, we do not have any responsibility for the actions of the Dolores Deals Merchant, and the actions of the Dolores Deals Merchant are not in our control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We may share your information with Authorized Third Party Service Providers.</strong> We provide services and products through third parties. These \"Third Party Service Providers\" perform functions on our behalf, like sending out and distributing our administrative and promotional emails. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with such Service Providers to fulfill orders, deliver packages, send postal or email, administer contests or sweepstakes, remove repetitive information on customer lists, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide search results and links, process credit card payments, operate the Website, troubleshoot, and provide customer service. We may also collect personal information from individuals and companies (\"Affiliates\") with whom we have business relationships and may share your information with Service Providers to accomplish our administrative tasks. For example, when you order a service, we release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for the service and, if applicable, release your address to the delivery service to deliver the service. Likewise, we may release an Affiliate's information to our bank to send out a payment. We encourage Dolores Deals Merchants and Third Party Service Providers to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by such parties is governed by the privacy policies of such parties and is not subject to our control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We may remarket your information.</strong> Remarketing is a way for us to connect with users, based upon your past interactions with the Dolores Deals website. Third-party marketing vendors may be hired by Dolores Deals to perform remarketing services. As a result, third-party vendors, may show Dolores Deals ads on sites on the internet. Third-party vendors, use cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to Dolores Deals' website. Users may opt out of targeted advertising delivered by NAI member ad networks here: http://www.networkadvertising.org/. This information is used only for remarketing purposes and will not be used by them for any other purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We may share your information in a Business Transfer.</strong> As with any other business, we could merge with, or be acquired by another company. If this occurs, the successor company would acquire the information we maintain, including Personally Identifiable Information. However, Personally Identifiable Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We may share your information for our Protection and the Protection of Others.</strong> We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Website; enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Website Terms of Use or other agreements; or protect the rights, property or safety of the Website, its Users or others.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Release of Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We may disclose or share Non-Personally Identifiable Information with Partners, Affiliates and Advertisers. For example, we may share aggregated demographic information (which does not include any Personally Identifiable Information) with \"Third Party Advertisers\" or \"Third Party Advertising Companies\" and other parties as provided below:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We use Third Party Advertising Companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide, through the use of network tags, advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Some of these Third Party Advertising Companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (\"NAI\"). If you would like more information about any NAI member company, or you would like to opt-out of targeted advertising from any NAI member company, visit <a href=\"http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp\">http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We also use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze Non-Personally Identifiable usage and volume statistical information from our Users to administer our Website and constantly improve its quality. We may also publish this information for promotional purposes or as a representative audience for Advertisers. Please note that this is not Personally Identifiable Information, only general summaries of the activities of our Users. Such data is collected on our behalf, and is owned and used by us.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Updating and Correcting Information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We believe that you should have the ability to access and edit the Personally Identifiable Information you provide us. You may change any of your Personally Identifiable Information by sending us an email at support@doloresdeals.org. Please indicate your name, address and email address, and what information you would like to update when you contact us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We encourage you to promptly update your Personally Identifiable Information if it changes. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on the Website. In addition, in may be impossible for us to completely delete all of your information because we periodically backup information.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. User Choices on Collection and Use of Information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, although it may be required to engage in a certain activity on the Website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a condition of purchase of our products and services, we will send you Administrative and Promotional emails. We will send you information regarding your account activity and purchases as well as updates about our products and promotional offers. You cannot opt-out of Administrative Emails. \"Administrative Emails\" relate to a User's activity on the Website, and include emails regarding a particular User's account, requests or inquiries, and purchases of products and services. In contrast to Administrative Emails, however, you do have a choice with respect to Promotional Emails. Promotional Emails advertise our products and services, including exclusive sales and other offers, and/or the products and services of our Advertisers and Affiliates. If you do not want to receive Promotional Emails from us, you may elect to opt-out of receiving Promotional Emails at any time after registering by e-mailing us at <a href=\"mailto:info@doloresdeals.org\">info@doloresdeals.org</a> or by hitting the \"unsubscribe\" button at the bottom of any of our e-mails. When contacting us, please indicate your name, address, email address, and what Promotional Emails you do not want to receive.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Security of Information</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We take security seriously and take numerous precautions to protect the security of Personally Identifiable Information. You can access your Personally Identifiable Information on our Website through a password and your email address. This password is encrypted. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone. In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information resides on a secure server that only selected personnel and contractors have access to. We encrypt certain sensitive information (such as credit card information) using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information is safe as it is transmitted to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we employ commercially reasonable security measures to protect data and seek to partner with companies which do the same, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Website, and are not responsible for the actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Data Tracking</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cookies.</strong> To facilitate and customize your experience with the Website, we store cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a User's computer for record-keeping purposes which contains information about that User. We use cookies to save you time while using the Website, remind us who you are, and track and target User interests in order to provide a customized experience. Cookies also allow us to collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information from you, like which pages you visited and what links you clicked on. Use of this information helps us to create a more user-friendly experience for all visitors. In addition, we may use Third Party Advertising Companies to display advertisements on our Website. As part of their service, they may place separate cookies on your computer. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by our Website only and does not cover the use of cookies by any Advertiser. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to modify your browser settings to decline cookies. Please note that if you decline or delete these cookies, some parts of the Website may not work properly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Other Tracking Devices.</strong> We may use other industry standard technologies like pixel tags and web beacons to track your use of our Website pages and promotions, or we may allow our Third Party Service Providers to use these devices on our behalf. Pixel tags and web beacons are tiny graphic images placed on certain pages on our Website, or in our emails that allow us to determine whether you have performed a specific action. When you access these pages or open or click an email, pixel tags and web beacons generate a Non-Personally Identifiable notice of that action. Pixel tags allow us to measure and improve our understanding of visitor traffic and behavior on our Website, as well as give us a way to measure our promotions and performance. We may also utilize pixel tags and web beacons provided by our Affiliates and/or Marketing Partners for the same purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9. Privacy Policies of Third Party Websites</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This Privacy Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you on www.doloresdeals.org. Other websites that may be accessible through this Website have their own privacy policies and data collection, use and disclosure practices.

Arbitration</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>By using this Site, End User agrees that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy End User may have against Dolores Deals arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with this Agreement, this Site, or any Microsite, or the purchase or sale of any Voucher(s), shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") and conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable Rules and Procedures established by AAA (\"Rules and Procedures\"); (2) the arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the Rules and Procedures (provided that such location is reasonably convenient for End User), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by End User and Dolores Deals; (3) the arbitrator shall apply California consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (4) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis; arbitration can decide only the End User's and/or Dolores Deals' individual claims; and the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (5) in the event that the End User is able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Dolores Deals will pay as much of the End User's filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (6) with the exception of subpart (4) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures established by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (4) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither End User nor Dolores Deals shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute.

By placing an order for a Voucher from a Merchant through Dolores Deals, you make an offer to purchase the Vouchers you have selected on the terms and conditions stated below. For more information about our collection of personal information, please view our Privacy Policy. You are required to create an account in order to purchase any Voucher. This is required so we can provide you with easy access to print your orders, view your past purchases, modify your preferences, and to ensure permissible use of the Voucher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Voucher you purchase through Dolores Deals is redeemable for goods or services by the Merchant. The Merchant, not Dolores Deals, is the seller of the Voucher and the goods and services and is solely responsible for redeeming any Voucher you purchase. Dolores Deals sells a Voucher that can be redeemed in connection with your purchase of the goods or services from Merchant.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>1. Terms and Conditions for Restaurant-Specific Vouchers</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>For this section, \"Restaurant\" shall be defined as a Merchant who offers food and beverage for sale in its regular business operations, and is making such food and beverages available to purchasers of Vouchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"unordered\">\r\n\t<li>Redemption frequency is determined by Restaurants, and shall be contained in the Voucher offer on the Site.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Use of Restaurant-Specific Vouchers for alcoholic beverages is at the sole discretion of the Restaurant and is subject to compliance with applicable law.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Vouchers cannot be combined with any other restaurant vouchers, third party certificates, coupons, or promotions, unless otherwise specified by Restaurant.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Restaurant-Specific Vouchers cannot be used for taxes, tips or prior balances, unless permitted by the Restaurant.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Valid for dine in only unless otherwise stated.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>The issuing of restaurant credit is at the sole discretion of the Restaurant unless otherwise required by applicable law.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Neither Dolores Deals nor the Restaurant is responsible for lost or stolen Vouchers or restaurant Voucher reference numbers.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Reproduction, sale or trade of a Restaurant-Specific Voucher is prohibited unless done so in compliance with applicable law.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Any attempted redemption not consistent with these terms & conditions will render the Restaurant-Specific Voucher void.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>Void to the extent prohibited by law.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>If you redeem the Voucher for less than its face value, you will only be entitled to a credit or cash from the Restaurant, equal to the difference between the face value and the amount you redeemed, if required by applicable law. You will only be entitled to a continuing redemption value as noted above if the amount that you paid for the Voucher exceeds the amount you redeemed. For example, if you paid $20 for a Voucher which entitles you to purchase $50 of product by February 1, 2010 and you make a purchase for $40 on January 30, 2010, you will only be entitled to a credit or cash equal to the difference between the $50 face value and the amount you redeemed from the Merchant (i.e., $10) if required by applicable law. You will not have any redemption value either because the amount you redeemed is more than what you paid for the Voucher.</li>\r\n\r\n\t<li>All purchases of Vouchers for Restaurants may have statutory limitations on the amount of the Voucher value that can be redeemed for alcoholic beverages. Compliance with state statutes or codes is the responsibility of the Merchant. Dolores Deals' sole role in the transaction is as a marketing agent for the Merchant Voucher, and the applicability and compliance with any relevant statute or code is solely determined and consummated by the Merchant, and Dolores Deals has no role in such determination or action on the part of the Merchant.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h4>2. Terms and Conditions for Non-Restaurant Merchant Vouchers</h4>\r\n\r\n<ul class=\"unordered\">\r\n\t<li>Merchant Voucher may be applied only to merchandise sold by Merchant, and may not be applied to shipping or handling charges.</li>\r\n\t<li>Limit one (1) Voucher per redemption. Only one Voucher can be used per order unless otherwise specified by Merchant.</li>\r\n\t<li>The issuing of credit is at the sole discretion of the Merchant unless otherwise required by law.\r\n\t<li>Neither Dolores Deals nor the Merchant is responsible for lost or stolen Vouchers or Voucher's reference number.</li>\r\n\t<li>Voucher cannot be combined with any other vouchers, third party certificates, coupons, or promotions, unless otherwise specified by Merchant.</li>\r\n\t<li>Reproduction, sale or trade of this Voucher is prohibited unless done so in compliance with applicable law.</li>\r\n\t<li>Any attempted redemption not consistent with these terms and conditions will render the Voucher null and void.</li>\r\n\t<li>Void to the extent prohibited by law.</li>\r\n\t<li>If you redeem the Voucher for less than its face value, you will only be entitled to a credit or cash equal to the difference between the face value and the amount you redeemed from the Merchant if required by law. You will only be entitled to a continuing redemption value as noted above if the amount that you paid for the Voucher exceeds the amount you redeemed. For example, if you paid $20 for a Voucher which entitles you to purchase $50 of product by February 1, 2010 and you make a purchase for $40 on January 30, 2010, you will only be entitled to a credit or cash equal to the difference between the $50 face value and the amount you redeemed from the Merchant (i.e., $10) if required by applicable law. You will not have any redemption value either because the amount you redeemed is more than what you paid for the Voucher.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h4>3. Additional Terms and Conditions for All Dolores Deals Vouchers</h4>\r\n\r\n<p>All Vouchers shall be subject to the terms and conditions of Dolores Deals and the participating Restaurant or Merchant. The Merchant or Restaurant are the sellers of the goods or services which you are purchasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The holder and issuer of a Restaurant-Specific Voucher is the Restaurant. The holder and issuer of a Merchant Voucher is the Merchant. As a holder and issuer of the Voucher, the Restaurant or Merchant shall be fully responsible for any and all injuries, illnesses, damages, claims, liabilities and costs suffered by or in respect of a customer, caused in whole or in part by the Restaurant or the Merchant, as well as for any unclaimed property liability arising from unredeemed Vouchers or portions thereof. You waive, and release Dolores Deals and its officers, directors, employees and agents from, any claim, liabilities, damages, or injury arising from or related to any act or omission of Merchant or Restaurant in connection with a Voucher or the services/goods provided in connection therewith and/or as it relates to compliance with applicable unclaimed property and other laws relating to the redemption of the Vouchers or any portion thereof. Restaurant-Specific Vouchers and Merchant Vouchers are redeemable in their entirety and on a one time basis only and may not be redeemed incrementally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to applicable law, the Merchant may be responsible for allowing you to redeem your Voucher for the cash value based on the money you actually paid for your Voucher (i.e. if you paid $20 for a Voucher which gives you $50 of value to the Merchant, the cash value that you paid is $20, not $50), for a period of time that extends beyond the expiration date on the Voucher. While the expiration date on the Voucher dictates the last date that you can use your Voucher at Merchant for the promotional offer stated on the Dolores Deals, applicable law may provide that the Merchant is responsible for honoring the cash value that you paid for your Voucher for a period of time beyond the expiration date stated on the Voucher. In other words, you should be allowed to redeem the cash value (or purchase price) of your Voucher up until the greater of: (1) the Voucher's expiration date; or (2) the minimum length of time allowed by applicable law for a Voucher to expire. In the event that you have an expired Voucher and would like to redeem it for the price you paid to acquire it, please contact the Merchant. Once again, the Merchant should allow such redemption if applicable law requires it, and we have instructed the Merchant to do so. If you have gone to the Merchant and the Merchant has refused to redeem the cash value of your expired Voucher, and if applicable law entitles you to such redemption, then please contact Dolores Deals [and explain your situation in writing] and Dolores Deals will refund the purchase price of the Voucher in either U.S. Dollars or credit for purchases of future Vouchers from Dolores Deals.</p>\r\n", "enable_comments": false}}
